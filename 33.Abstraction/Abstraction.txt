Abstraction : Abstraction is process of hiding internal implementation 
and only highlightimg those services we are offering is called as abstraction.

Example : ATM.


How to achive abstraction java?

1)Abstract class(80 %)
2)Interface(100 %)


1)Abstract class(80 %): A class which contain abstract keyword in its declaration is called as abstract class.

Syntax: public abstract  class Demo{
-----------
----------
---------
}


Rule 1) We cant create object of abstract class.

Example :


package abstraction;

public abstract class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		Demo d=new Demo();// we cant create object of abstract class.
	}
}





Rule 2) abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods.
       abstract methods we can declare only.
       non abstract methods can have implementation.


Example:

package abstraction;

public abstract class Demo {

  public abstract void display(); // abstract method
	public void show() {// non abstract method
		
	}
}



Rule 3: Abstract class may or may not contaion abstract methods.


Example 1:


package abstraction;

public abstract class Demo {

  public abstract void display(); // abstract method
	public void show() {// non abstract method
		
	}
}

Example 2:


package abstraction;

public abstract class Demo {

 
	public void show() {// non abstract method
		
	}
}


Rule no 4: I f we take one or more abstract methods in class then we have to compusary make class as abstract.

Example :

package abstraction;

public abstract class Demo {

 public abstract void display();
 
 public abstract void show();
 
	public void show1() {// non abstract method
		
	}
}
