StringBuilder: It is introduced in java 1.5 version.
1) Every method present in StringBuffer is synchronized hence at a time only one Thread will be 
allowed to operate on the StringBuffer Object due to this waiting time of Thred will be increased
and it effects the perfomance of system.
To Overcome this problem String Builder came into picture.


String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder:

1) If the content is fixed and wont change frequently then we should go for String.

2)If the content will change frequently but Thread safety is required then we should 
go for StringBuffer.

3)If the content will change frequently but Thread safety is not required then we should 
go for StringBuilder.
